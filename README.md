![Protree example](./assets/protree-cover-image.jpg "Protree example")

## **About**

This template aims to simplify the procedure for building Potree-based platform for bridge survey data sharing.

The repository and template has been defined for implementing the following features:

* **Pointcloud visualisation** with both RGB and classification appearance;
* **Oriented images** on the model for direct exploration of drone images used for the reconstruction;
* **Annotations** definition to highlight specific bridge elements, possibly embedding multimedia or actions in their descriptions.

## **Getting started**

To start, sign in [Github](https://github.com/login)
and navigate to the [Protree GitHub template](https://github.com/Tars4815/protree),
where you will see a green **Use this template** button.
Click it to open a new page that will ask you for some details:

* Introduce an appropriate "*Repository name*".
* Make sure the project is "*Public*", rather than "*Private*".

After that, click on the green **Create repository from template** button,
which will generate a new repository on your personal account
(or the one of your choosing).

This repository contains the following files:

***README.md***

Basic description of the repository with instructions on how to replicate the Protree template.

***index.html***

This will be the homepage of the Protree viewer. It contains the basic settings for the GUI and includes the paths to all the style and js files.
