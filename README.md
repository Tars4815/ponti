# **protree**

A custom Potree template for sharing survey products of provincial bridges.

![Protree example](./assets/protree-cover-image.jpg "Protree example")

## **About**

This template aims to simplify the procedure for building Potree-based platform for bridge survey data sharing.

The repository and template has been defined for implementing the following features:

* **Pointcloud visualisation** with both RGB and classification appearance;
* **Oriented images** on the model for direct exploration of drone images used for the reconstruction;
* **Annotations** definition to highlight specific bridge elements, possibly embedding multimedia or actions in their descriptions.

## **Getting started**

To start, sign in [Github](https://github.com/login)
and navigate to the [Protree GitHub template](https://github.com/Tars4815/protree),
where you will see a green **Use this template** button.
Click it to open a new page that will ask you for some details:

* Introduce an appropriate "*Repository name*".
* Make sure the project is "*Public*", rather than "*Private*".

After that, click on the green **Create repository from template** button,
which will generate a new repository on your personal account
(or the one of your choosing).

This repository contains the following files:

***README.md***

Basic description of the repository with instructions on how to replicate the Protree template.

***index.html***

This will be the homepage of the Protree viewer. It contains the basic settings for the GUI and includes the paths to all the style and js files.

***assets***

Decorative images and icons are collected in this folder. Additionally, two others subfolders contain files that are important to define the appearance and the custom functionalities of the viewer:

* *CSS* with the stylesheet in CSS language defined for including in the GUI a header with a description and/or logo.

* *JS* that includes JavaScript files for loading 3D products in the viewer.

***img_selected***

This folder is used to store and collect the oriented images that the viewer developer is willing to integrate on the platform. Together with the picture files, camera certificates and images orientation parameters are saved in this space.

***libs***

All libraries' dependencies for making functionable the viewer are saved in the sub-folders.

***licenses***

License specifications for the used libraries are descripted here.

***pointclouds***

Converted point clouds and ancillary files should be saved in this folder to preserve the template structure.
